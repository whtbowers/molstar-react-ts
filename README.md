# Molstar React Typescript Wrapper

This library wraps the macromolecular visualisation tool [Molstar](https://github.com/molstar/molstar) for both dynamic styling and interactivity in the context of larger React projects, due to its support for TypeScript and Strict Mode.

Whilst there is an existing [molstar-react](https://github.com/samirelanduk/molstar-react), the version of molstar required is a few versions behind, and uses typed Javascript rather than Typescript.

Upcoming work:
* Further documentation.
* Surfacing capability to feed in file contents as string.
